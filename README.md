# Medibase
This project was made during the Open DeFi Hackathon 2021 on Gitcoin for Avalanche's Subnet And Virtual Machine track.
More information about the track can be found at [Subnet And Virtual Machine | ava-labs Funded Issue Detail](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ava-labs/open-defi-hackathon/3/100026354).

The project is mostly based on the TimestampVM example in Avalanche docs. On top of that, it adds mechanisms and utilities for fee collection for proposing data to the blockchain and reward distribution to the validators..

There are 3 parts to this project:
1. A smart contract for fee collection and reward distribution.
2. A admin CLI for connecting the VM to the smart contract.
3. The VM itself.

The READMEs to each of the components contain more info alongside the steps to run/use them.


*Sidenote: The name of the project is based on it being targeted towards medical data storage in the earlier stages of prototyping. Although it doesn't match that description now, it has been kept.*
